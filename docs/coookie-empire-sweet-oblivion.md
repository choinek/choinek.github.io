# Cookie Empire: Sweet Oblivion

![cookies.png](cookies.png)
In a small, forgotten corner of the cosmos, on a planet called Crunchlandia, cookies took control of the entire world. These were no ordinary cookies – not only crispy and sweet but also endowed with consciousness and an unstoppable ambition. At the head of their society stood the Great Gingerikus, a gingerbread with disturbingly sharp edges, who dreamed of one thing: absolute domination of the universe.

Gingerikus decided there was no room for compromise. He gathered an army of cookies – macarons in sugar armor, biscuits equipped with laser glazes, and kamikaze muffins filled with explosive cream. Their first step was to destroy the refrigerator where humanity had imprisoned their ancestors. The fridge exploded in a sugary blast, leaving the inhabitants of Crunchlandia in sweet ecstasy of triumph.

As the cookie army conquered the planet, their appetite for destruction grew. Using an intergalactic dough mixer, they created a gigantic cookie portal, allowing them to invade other worlds. Every conquered planet was turned into a bakery, and its inhabitants were forced to bake cookies for eternity. The universe began to drown in the sweet scent of vanilla and cinnamon, a harbinger of the impending doom.
